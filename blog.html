            <!-- difference local storage and session storage -->

 sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.

                                 <!-- No : 2 -->
            <!-- different of local scope and global scope -->
Global variables are useful for values that are relatively constant, or that many functions in the script must access, such as a session id. A local variable, however, has a limited scope: it exists only within the block that it is declared in. Once that block ends, the variable is destroyed and its values lost

                        <!-- why pass result undefined -->
A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned
